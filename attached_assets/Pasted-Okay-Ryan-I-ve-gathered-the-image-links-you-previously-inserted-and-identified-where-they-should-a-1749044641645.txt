Okay, Ryan, I've gathered the image links you previously inserted and identified where they should appear in the website layout.

Here's the list:

Main Banner Image (Kraków Main Square):

URL: https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.c5faf32a80d29a8cca76d0cd036ae9a1?rik=c6ZVtZG0uinWpA&pid=ImgRaw&r=0
Placement: This image is used as the main banner at the top of the page, below the header and above the main content grid.
Current HTML <img> tag alt text: "Banner image of Kraków Main Square"
Day 1 Image (Kraków Night Street):

URL: https://primetourskrakow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DOMINIK-NIGHT.jpg
Placement: Within the Day 1 section, after the details for "Mercy Brown" cocktails.
Current HTML <img> tag alt text: "Kraków street at night"
Day 2 Image (Wawel Castle Courtyard):

URL: https://s.inyourpocket.com/gallery/299657.jpg
Placement: Within the Day 2 section, after the details for "Schindler's Factory tour" and before the "Starka Restaurant" dinner suggestion.
Current HTML <img> tag alt text: "Wawel Castle Courtyard"
Day 3 Image (Wieliczka Salt Mine Chapel):

URL: https://i.redd.it/qnlga60nz3o41.jpg
Placement: Within the Day 3 section, after the details for the "Wieliczka Salt Mine tour" and before the "Mleczarnia" lunch suggestion.
Current HTML <img> tag alt text: "Wieliczka Salt Mine Chapel"
Day 4 Image (Auschwitz / Nowa Huta context):

URL: https://cdn.britannica.com/35/147835-050-F63661FC/entrance-gates-concentration-camp-Auschwitz-Krakow-Poland.jpg
Placement: Within the Day 4 section. You originally had this image after the "Option A: Nowa Huta" details and before the "Option B: Auschwitz-Birkenau" details. Given the image content (Auschwitz gates), it's more visually relevant to Option B. The alt text was "Nowa Huta architecture". You might want to place it directly within or after the "Option B" description, or choose a different image if you want one specifically for Nowa Huta.
Current HTML <img> tag alt text: "Nowa Huta architecture" (Consider changing if placed with Option B).
Day 5 Image (Ostrów Tumski at Dusk):
